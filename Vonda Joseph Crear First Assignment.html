  <h1>"About Me"</h1>
  <h2><strong>My Hobbies</strong></h2>
  <p>    
  This webpage is about me and my hobbies, interests and goals in life. I am currently
   and wife and mother and my goal is to become a Software Engineer working remotely and 
   be able to be near my family. Currently, my occupation is truck driving with the desire to be 
  home more. Interior decorating and design is my greatest hobby, but I have always had a love for computers.
  
  It has been a blessing for me to find UTA's Quickstart Software Engineering Bootcamp. I have been praying 
  God would send me the direction that he wanted me to go and he has with UTA's Quickstart Bootcamp. I
  have been so amazed at how much we have learned in such a short period of time. I am also excited to see 
  where this journey takes me and how coding and websites development interconnect.
 </p>
  <h2><strong>My Goals</strong></h2> 
  I hope to learn and understand how <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> works as well. I 
  have been researching and I am learning how software development and artifical intelligence works 
  together. I am interested however, in using my software engineering skills to assist doctors and medical staff in upgrading 
  and maintaining the <em>Electronic Patient Record Software (EPR)</em>or the<em>Medical Records Software (EMR)
